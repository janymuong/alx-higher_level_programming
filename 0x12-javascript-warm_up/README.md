# JavaScript

## Warm-Up
JavaScript is a `high-level`, `interpreted` **programming language** primarily used for web development. It enables dynamic and interactive behavior on websites. JavaScript can be used both on the frontend (client-side) and the backend (server-side) of web applications.

## Key Features
1. **Client-Side Scripting:** JavaScript runs directly in the web browser, allowing it to manipulate web page elements, handle user interactions, and dynamically update content without requiring a page reload. This enables interactive and responsive web experiences.

2. **Versatility:** JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for a wide range of tasks beyond web development. It can be used for server-side development (for example: `Node.js` - a `JavaScript runtime`), mobile app development (React Native), desktop applications, and even game development, et cetera.

3. **Event-Driven Programming:** JavaScript follows an event-driven programming model, where code is executed in response to events like user actions (clicks, keystrokes), timer events, or network requests. This model allows developers to build interactive and asynchronous applications easily.

4. **Dynamic Typing:** JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly define variable types. Variables can hold different types of values, and their types can change during runtime. This flexibility simplifies development but requires careful handling to avoid type-related errors.

5. **Extensive Ecosystem:** JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that simplify development. Popular frameworks include `React`, Angular, and Vue.js, while libraries like Lodash and Axios offer additional functionality.


## Examples JavaScript usage:

- **Web Development:** JavaScript is commonly used for front-end development to create interactive web pages, handle form submissions, perform client-side validations, and make AJAX calls to servers for data retrieval or updates.

- **Server-Side Development:** With Node.js, JavaScript can be used for server-side development to build scalable and efficient web applications. It allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs on the server, handling requests, accessing databases, and managing business logic.

- **Browser APIs:** JavaScript provides access to various browser APIs, such as the Document Object Model (DOM), which allows manipulation of HTML elements, handling events, and creating dynamic user interfaces.

- **Data Manipulation:** JavaScript offers powerful tools for working with data. It supports objects, arrays, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), and provides methods for data transformation, filtering, and mapping.

In this intro-context, JavaScript usage is demo for `scripting`.
