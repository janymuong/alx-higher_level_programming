# JavaScript
## Objects, Scopes and Closures;

> Covers: *objects*, *scopes* and *closures* in the context of JavaScript ES6 classes, prototyping, constructors, namespace, keywords: `super`, `this`, `self`, `extends` etc    
> Builds on [0x12-javascript-warm_up](../0x12-javascript-warm_up)  

This project covers the fundamentals of working with objects in JavaScript, including object creation, accessing properties, and manipulating object data.

Explores object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript: `ES6` encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### glossary
- `closures`;

- `this/self`;  
Refer to the current context or object and are commonly used to access and manipulate object properties and methods.

- `super`;  
Used to call the parent class's constructor and access its methods and properties.

- `extend`;  
Creates a child class that inherits properties and methods from a parent class, facilitating code reuse and hierarchy.
