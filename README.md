# High - Level Languages
---

Repository for `high-level` programming languages.

Each directory represents a segment of a `programming language` to work on/learn about incrementally.
The regular files in directories individually represent a concept(s) or part of a concept in syntax and semantics of the language.      
This mainly covers `Python`.
