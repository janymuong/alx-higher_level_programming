## `python`: Data Structures - Lists, Tuples
---

Covers `sequence data types` - `lists`, and `tuples`.

> Def: 	  
> Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application).
> Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples which could be lists). 

> Also focuses (slightly or not slightly) on zero based indexing, slicing and generally lexicographical operations as a general approach to **sequence types**.
