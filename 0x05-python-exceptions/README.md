Exceptions occur when `parsing` a sequence of characters in **Python**.
Sample exceptions **types**:
```bash
- KeyboardInterrupt (Control-C)
- ValueError
- SyntaxError
- ZeroDivisionError
- IndexError
- NameError
```
An exception is not fatal and thus can be can be handled - in a `try execept finally else` flow.
