## `python` - if/else, loops, functions
---
Directory for **Control Flow** in Python.	 

These covers how statements affect or control the execution of code or other statements wrapped within the execution of a block and in functions.

Control flow and operations are done on an iterable, that is, an object suitable as a target for functions and constructs that expect something from which they can obtain successive items until the supply is exhausted. 

### sample concepts covered:
> `if/else`, `loops`, `statement grouping`, `functions`

Also, this covers elementary introduction to `Python` and its `syntax`. So, there is a few **Python** files for this as well as well as build up from the preceding directory [0x00-python-hello_world](../0x00-python-hello_world).
