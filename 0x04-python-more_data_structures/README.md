A `set` is an unordered collection with no duplicate elements.   
Sample basic use cases: membership testing, eliminating duplicate entries.   
Set objects also support mathematical operations like union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

`Dictionaries` are indexed by keys, which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers,  `tuples` of **type** strings, numbers, or tuples.
A Python **dictionary** is basically a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary).    
The main operations on a dictionary are storing a value with some key and extracting the value given the key. Other operations are also possible eg deletion, sorting etc.
