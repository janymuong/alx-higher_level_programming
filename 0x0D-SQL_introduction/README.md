`SQL` (short for **Structured Query Language**) is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases.  
It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing you to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.  
In SQL, data is stored in tables, which represent entities or concepts. Tables consist of columns (fields) that define the type of data stored and rows (records) that contain the actual data.

SQL is broadly classified into:
- `Data Definition Language` (DDL): DDL statements (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`) are used to define and modify the structure of the database objects, such as tables, indexes, and constraints.

- `Data Manipulation Language` (DML): SQL's DML statements allow you to interact with the data stored in the database. These statements enable you to retrieve, insert, modify, or delete data.  
> `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`

## Queries
SQL queries are used to retrieve specific data from a database. Queries are constructed using various statements, such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `JOIN`, to perform operations on the data.
